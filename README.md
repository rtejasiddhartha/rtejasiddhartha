## Profile

I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL-driven analysis, automated reporting, and dashboarding.  
My work focuses on **clarity, accuracy, and business relevance**, not just technical execution.

I have supported **production systems**, investigated **data and transaction failures**, and built **analytics pipelines** that enable teams to act with confidence.
